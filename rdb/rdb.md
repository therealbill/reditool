# Package Purpose

This package will exist to provide a reusable library for interacting
with the Redis RDB format. This is the file format for a Redis snapshot
and is the data format used in master/slave SYNC calls.

Hopefully it will provide various methods for acting on or modifying
data in an RDB construct.

# Things You Should Be Able To Do

You should be able to read in an RDB file and analyze it, perhaps audit
it.
