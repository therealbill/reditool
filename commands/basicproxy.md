# TODO: Command:  Basic-Proxy

This command should provide the base for a transparent debug proxy to be
used between a remote Redis server and a local instance. It could be
useful for profiling an application's Redis usage or for use as a mock
Redis server to inject tests and boundary conditions to simulate various
Redis failures.
